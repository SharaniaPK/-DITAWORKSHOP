                architecture for authoring, producing, and delivering topic-oriented,
                information-typed content that can be reused and single-sourced in a variety of
                ways. While <ph class="- topic/ph " keyref="name" xtrc="ph:3;18:47" xtrf="file:/C:/DITA%20Workshop/Week_3_Assignment/introduction_to_dita.dita">DITA</ph> historically has been driven by the
                requirements of large-scale technical documentation authoring, management, and
                delivery, it is a standard that is applicable to any kind of publication or
                information that might be presented to readers, including interactive training and
                educational materials, standards, reports, business documents, trade books, travel
                and nature guides, and more.</p>

                describing new information domains based on existing types and domains. The process
                for creating new types and domains is called specialization. Specialization enables
                the creation of specific, targeted XML grammars that can still use tools and design
                rules that were developed for more general types and domains; this is similar to how
                classes in an object-oriented system can inherit the methods of ancestor
                classes.</p>
